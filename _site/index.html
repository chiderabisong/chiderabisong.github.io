  <div>
    
    
    Oreamnos americanus, the Latin name for the mountain goat, is an even-toed ungulate, belonging to the order Artiodactyla (Festa-Bianchet M., 2008). Despite having “goat” in its name, the mountain goat is not a true goat, but belongs to the family Bovidae which comprises of animals like gazelles, cattle, and antelopes, however, it belongs to the subfamily of Caprinae (goat- antelopes), which is comprised of 32 other species including the true goats, the chamois, muskox, and sheep (Festa-Bianchet M., 2008).

  <div>
    
    
    It is believed that the ancestors of the Mountain Goat crossed the Bering land bridge between Siberia and Alaska just before the most recent Wisconsin glaciation. Mountain Goat fossils dating up to 100,000 years old have been found south of the glacial limit in the United States (Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks, 2000). 12,000 years ago, two different species of Mountain Goat were present in the southwest United States; Oreamnos americanus and the smaller Oreamnos haringtoni (Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks, 2000). When the last Cordilleran ice sheet began to wane, Harington’s goat became extinct and Oreamnos americanus, what we currently know as the Mountain Goat, travelled north to the snowy mountains it favours.

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    The City of Brandon, Manitoba is growing and this has led to more waste being generated by the populace. The city has directed planners to prepare a plan for the expansion of its existing landfill that was to be upgraded into a comprehensive waste management facility. This new facility will be similar to the waste management facilities used in bigger cities such as Winnipeg and will have greater resource recovery, an upgrade from the regular dump and bury system of the landfill. The proposed facility is set to have several new features like a resource recovery center, green research park, composting facility and landfill gas capture area. The facility will also be able to carry out recycling and composting. It will also be able to accept the disposal of scrap metal, used tires, propane tanks and appliances.

  <div>
    
    
    Conservation Biogeography and the Anthropocene have everything to do with each other. Considering how much the Anthropocene has affected the environment, the impact has been truly tremendous; affecting the Earth’s biodiversity and altering the biogeographic trend over time. The Anthropocene indeed provoked the need for conservation, without it, the Earth’s self-sustaining natural processes would continue as normal. However, in present time, there is a great need for conservation measures as never before because man’s activities are beyond unsustainable.

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    The new CEAA 2012 Act has been met with a lot of changes and has had a huge impact on various environmental sectors and even on the environmental processes that existed before the revamp. Firstly, the process through which the CEAA 2012 was introduced has been highly questionable and criticized for being too rushed and thereby breaking due procedures. It did not have preliminary proposals and looked to be powered too quickly through the legislative process, with no debate about the implications of proposed changes (Kirchhoff, Gardner & Tsuji, 2013).

    The goal of this Ecosystem Management Plan is to increase the health and size of the Netley-Libau Marsh in Lake Winnipeg. For this goal to be achieved we have four objectives and these are (1). Identification of the importance and functions of the Netley-Libau wetland. (2). Identification of the sources of degradation to the wetland and develop strategies for restoration. (3). Establishing and implementing strategies for the conservation of the Netley-Libau Marsh (4). Developing a framework for long term stakeholder involvement in wetland conservation and restoration in Lake Winnipeg.

    The Burrowing Owl was first listed as endangered in 1992 by regulation under Manitoba’s Endangered Species Act. They are currently still listed as endangered within Manitoba, as well as the rest of Canada. The burrowing owls are also protected under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act (Government, 2017). The Manitoba Burrowing Owl Recovery Program (MBORP) is a non-profit organization that works towards increasing the population of Burrowing Owls in Manitoba. Each year soft- releases are done with breeding pairs. The recovery program collects research information each year such as productivity relating to clutch size, hatching success, survival of young, foraging of males post-hatching, home range size, diet/prey use, dispersal, mortality, return rates/survival, and other behaviors.

  <div>
    
    
    This paper will discuss Feral Cats and best management practices. Providing options, the city of Winnipeg can adopt to best manage its Feral cats’ population. Feral cats, or in some communities referred to as Free-ranging/roaming cats, are cats that live outdoors in colonies and have little or no human contact. These cats become problematic to the environment because they can begin to affect native wildlife species through predation and thereby trip the balance of natural ecosystems. The Wildlife Society refers to Feral cats as Exotic species to North America, and exotic species are known to cause problems for native species. Most North American cities including Winnipeg, have problems in managing Feral Cats. This report will examine a management technique for Feral Cats in which the city of Winnipeg can adopt to curb Feral Cats population. In addition, information on Feral Cats in Winnipeg will be examined and reported.

    This report looks at the ever-persisting problem of plastic bags, of which ever since its inception has been a torn in the flesh to the environment. A brief background would be provided on the subject matter; how it came about as well as its usage. Where the most issues with plastic bags lie is in its disposal stage, that is, when it becomes waste. A good examination is done on the pollution that is released to the environment from plastic waste. But pollution is not only wrought during its waste stage, but also during its production. A good examination is done on how the production of plastic bags can pollute the environment and even lead to climate change. The pollution from production is also found to affect human health.

    The Snowball Earth period is a time when the Earth's surface became almost entirely frozen from pole to pole. This is concept still has the status of hypothesis as it’s still a widely debated topic. It is rather interesting to know that a tropical distribution of the continents is allows for the initiation of a Snowball Earth. Tropical continents are more reflective than open oceans, and thereby absorb less of the sun's heat - most absorption of solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans. This paper would examine the Snowball earth hypothesis as well as discuss the impacts of this event both on greenhouse gases and on biological life. It will also discuss the possible causes of the event.

So I’m tackling this project from an holistic level involving all forms of water consumed by me. The project will run for the space of approximately three months, beginning officially on the 20th of January, 2016 and would run up to the last day of class on the 6th of April, 2016. At the end of the project a review assessment would be carried out to see the outcome of the project; evaluating the efficiency and significance of the project and also seeing how effective it would be assuming it is carried out by a much larger number of individuals and families.

title: Feral Cats Management in Winnipeg & North America
categories: [Wildlife]
description: This paper will discuss Feral Cats and best management practices. Providing options, the city of Winnipeg can adopt to best manage its Feral catsâ€™ population. Feral cats, or in some communities referred to as Free-ranging/roaming cats, are cats that live outdoors in colonies and have little or no human contact. These cats become problematic to the environment because they can begin to affect native wildlife species through predation and thereby trip the balance of natural ecosystems. The Wildlife Society refers to Feral cats as Exotic species to North America, and exotic species are known to cause problems for native species. Most North American cities including Winnipeg, have problems in managing Feral Cats. This report will examine a management technique for Feral Cats in which the city of Winnipeg can adopt to curb Feral Cats population. In addition, information on Feral Cats in Winnipeg will be examined and reported.

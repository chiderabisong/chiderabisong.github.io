title: Personal Sustainability Project Plan
categories: [Sustainability]
description: My personal sustainability project will focus on an exercise carried out by me to reduce my rate of water consumption. Water consumption defined as any form of water usage either in the form of assimilation (drinking water) or for other domestic purposes like shower, toilet flushing, tooth brushing, kitchen, or even gardening. So Iâ€™m tackling this project from an holistic level involving all forms of water consumed by me. The project will run for the space of approximately three months, beginning officially on the 20th of January, 2016 and would run up to the last day of class on the 6th of April, 2016. At the end of the project a review assessment would be carried out to see the outcome of the project; evaluating the efficiency and significance of the project and also seeing how effective it would be assuming it is carried out by a much larger number of individuals and families.

title: Brandon Landfill - Community Resource Management Facility (Landfill), An Environmental Assessment
categories: [Environmental Assessment]
description: The City of Brandon, Manitoba is growing and this has led to more waste being generated by the populace. The city has directed planners to prepare a plan for the expansion of its existing landfill that was to be upgraded into a comprehensive waste management facility. This new facility will be similar to the waste management facilities used in bigger cities such as Winnipeg and will have greater resource recovery, an upgrade from the regular dump and bury system of the landfill. The proposed facility is set to have several new features like a resource recovery center, green research park, composting facility and landfill gas capture area. The facility will also be able to carry out recycling and composting. It will also be able to accept the disposal of scrap metal, used tires, propane tanks and appliances.
